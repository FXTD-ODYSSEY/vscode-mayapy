-----------------------------------------

colorEditor is undoable, queryable, and NOT editable.

The colorEditor command displays a modal dialog that may be used to specify
colors in RGB or HSV. The default behaviour when no arguments are specified is
to provide an initial color of black (rgb 0.0 0.0 0.0).

The command will return the user's color component values along with a boolean
to indicate whether the dialog was dismissed by pressing the "OK" button. As
an alternative to responding to the colorEditor command's return string you
can now query the -rgb/rgbValue, -hsv/hsvValue, and -r/result flags to get the
same information.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The string format is "float float float boolean". The first three
float values correspond to the color components.

The final argument is 1 if the dialog's "OK" button was pressed, and 0 if the
"Cancel" button was pressed.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

a     : alpha           [float] ['query']
    Float values corresponding to the alpha transparency component, , which ranges from 0.0 to 1.0. Use this flag to specify the initial alpha value of the Color Editor, or query this flag to determine the alpha value set in the editor.

-----------------------------------------

hsv   : hsvValue        [[float, float, float]] ['query']
    Three float values corresponding to the hue, saturation, and value color components, where the hue value ranges from 0.0 to 360.0 and the saturation and value components range from 0.0 to 1.0. Use this flag to specify the initial color of the Color Editor, or query this flag to determine the color set in the editor.

-----------------------------------------

pos   : position        [[int, int]] []
    Specify the window position for the dialog.

-----------------------------------------

r     : result          [boolean] ['query']
    This query only flag returns true if the dialog's "OK" button was pressed, false otherwise. If you query this flag immediately after showing the Color Editor then it will return the same value as the boolean value returned in the colorEditor command's return string.

-----------------------------------------

rgb   : rgbValue        [[float, float, float]]
    Three float values corresponding to the red, green, and blue color components, all of which range from 0.0 to 1.0. Use this flag to specify the initial color of the Color Editor, or query this flag to determine the color set in the editor.

confirmDialog is undoable, NOT queryable, and NOT editable.

The confirmDialog command creates a modal dialog with a message to the user
and a variable number of buttons to dismiss the dialog. The dialog is
dismissed when the user presses any button or chooses the close item from the
window menu. In the case where a button is pressed then the name of the button
selected is returned. If the dialog is dismissed via the close item then the
string returned is specified by the dismissString flag.

The default behaviour when no arguments are specified is to create an empty
single button dialog.

Return Value:

string  Indicates how the dialog was dismissed. If a button is pressed then
the label of the button is returned. If the dialog is closed then the value
for the flag dismissString is returned.

icn   : icon            [string] []
    The user can specify one of the four standard icons -- "question", "information", "warning" and "critical". The question icon indicates that the messsage is asking a question. The information icon indicates that the message is nothing out of the ordinary. The warning icon indicates that the message is a warning, but can be dealt with. The critical icon indicates that the message represents a critical problem. When no icon flag is present, we assume the user does not want to include any icon in the confirm dialog.

aec   : addExtraControls [boolean] []
    By default, if there are attributes of a node which you do not -addControl or -suppress, then controls will be created automatically and appended to the end of editor created from the template. This flag allows you to specify a particular place in the template for such controls to be automatically inserted. If dynamic attributes have not already been addressed with -addControl, they will also be placed here. A frameLayout will automatically be generated for you when you use this flag.

addSeparator : addSeparator    [boolean] []
    Adds a separator to the template.

-----------------------------------------

afo   : annotateFieldOnly [boolean] []
    This flag can only be used with the -annotation flag. By default, for any Attribute Editor controlGroups created by the -addControl flag, the -annotation flag displays its annotation string when the mouse hovers over any control that is part (the label, the value field, etc.) of the group. Use this flag to limit display of the annotation to only the value field of the controlGroup. This flag is ignored if the controlGroup has no value field (e.g., checkBoxGrp)

ccu   : callCustom      [boolean] []
    Specifies that at this point in the template when building the dialog, the procedure specified by the first argument is to be called to create some UI objects when a new node type is edited. The procedure specified by the second argument is to be called if an attribute editor already exists and another node of the same type is now to be edited. The replacing procedure should connect any controls created by the creating procedure to the equivalent attributes in the new node. A list of zero or more attributes specifies the attributes which the two procedures will involve. The procedures should have the signature:                proc AEcustomNew(string attributeName1, string attributeName2)       The number of attributes specified in the call should correspond to the number of attributes in the procedure signature.

-----------------------------------------

cl    : collapse        [boolean] []
    This flag is only valid when used in conjunction with a -bl/beginLayout flag. It is used to specify the initial expand/collapse state of the layout. A true value will cause the layout to be collapsed upon creation, while a false value will expand the layout. The default is true (ie. collapsed).

po    : preventOverride [boolean] []
    If true, this flag disallows overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.

-----------------------------------------

qc    : queryControl    [[string, string]] []
    This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag). The first argument is the node name and the second is the attribute whose control you wish to query. Note that in most cases, using this flag is identical to issuing a getAttr command, however, in the case of textFields (e.g. for message attributes), the text value currently being displayed will be returned, NOT the actual attribute value.

-----------------------------------------

ql    : queryLabel      [[string, string]] []
    This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag). The first argument is the node name and the second is the attribute whose control label you wish to query. In most cases this flag returns the same value as the attribute's nice name, but when a -label flag was present on the -addControl command that created the control, -queryLabel will return that value instead

-----------------------------------------

qn    : queryName       [[string, string]] []
    This flag is only useful AFTER a control has already been created (using the -addControl flag). The first argument is the node name and the second is the attribute whose control name you wish to query.

ep    : endProgress     [boolean] []
    Terminates the progress window. No other flags can be used at the same time. This is normally issued through MEL in response to the -ic/isCancelled flag being set or if the progress value reaches its maximum.

-----------------------------------------

ic    : isCancelled     [boolean] ['query']
    Returns true if the user has tried to cancel the operation. Returns false otherwise.

-----------------------------------------

ii    : isInterruptable [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Returns true if the progress window should respond to attempts to cancel the operation. The cancel button is disabled if this is set to true.

-----------------------------------------

max   : maxValue        [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The maximum or "ending" value of the progress indicator. If the progress value is greater than the -max/maxValue, the progress value will be set to the maximum. Default value is 100.

-----------------------------------------

min   : minValue        [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The minimum or "starting" value of the progress indicator. If the progress value is less than the -min/minValue, the progress value will be set to the minimum. Default value is 0.

-----------------------------------------

pr    : progress        [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The amount of progress currently shown on the control. The value will always be between min and max. Default is equal to the minimum when the control is created.

-----------------------------------------

st    : status          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    The status text appearing above the progress gauge.

-----------------------------------------

promptDialog is undoable, queryable, and NOT editable.

The promptDialog command creates a modal dialog with a message to the user, a
text field in which the user may enter a response, and a variable number of
buttons to dismiss the dialog. The dialog is dismissed when the user presses
any button or chooses the close item from the window menu. In the case where a
button is pressed then the name of the button selected is returned. If the
dialog is dismissed via the close item then the string returned is specified
by the -ds/dismissString flag.

The default behaviour when no arguments are specified is to create an empty
single button dialog.

To obtain the text entered by the user simply query the -tx/text flag.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Indicates how the dialog was dismissed. If a button is pressed then
the label of the button is returned. If the dialog is closed then the value
for the flag ds/dismissString is returned.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

window is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a new window but leaves it invisible. It is most
efficient to add the window's elements and then make it visible with the

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

hyperGraph is undoable, queryable, and editable.

The following is an overview of the basic features of the hypergraph. A more
detailed description is given in the user manuals.

The hypergraph provides the user with the ability to view and edit the maya
scene graph. The hypergraph supports two types of graphs: the DAG or scene
hierarchy and the dependency graph.

The default view of the hypergraph editor is the DAG view. The user can show
the dependency graph for a collection of nodes by first selecting the nodes
and navigating to the dependency graph using one of the graph options. The
user can save any view by setting a bookmark to that view. The user can also
show previous views using the view options provided.

The hypergraph supports a simple editing mechanism for editing hierarchy in
the DAG view and connections in dependency graph view. In the DAG view, the
user can reparent or reorder nodes in the graph using drag-and-drop. In the
dependency graph view, the user can select connections and delete them or make
new connections by dragging and dropping nodes or existing connections.

The hypergraph supports two layout modes in the DAG view: automatic and
freeform. In automatic mode, the graph nodes are automatically positioned
according to the layout preferences. In freeform mode, the user can position
nodes manually. The node position is saved in the scene. A background image
can be placed behind DG or DAG in freeform mode. This can be used as a
template for positioning nodes in a user-defined layout.

Nodes in the DAG view can be expanded or collapsed. The state is saved in the
scene. The performance of the graph drawing will increase as hierarchies are
collapsed.

In addition to hierachy relationships, the hypergraph can show expression,
constraint and deformation relationships in the DAG. These can be
enabled/disabled through the options provided. There are also additional
filters for showing shape nodes and invisible nodes. The amount of detail show
may affect the speed of the display of the graph.

Most of the UI features of the hypergraph are addressable through the
hypergraph command-line interface. The available command-line options are
described in the next section.

-----------------------------------------

nodeOutliner is undoable, queryable, and editable.

The nodeOutliner command creates, edits and queries an outline control that
shows dependency nodes and their attributes. Compound attributes are further
expandable to show their children. Additional configure flags allow multi
selection, customizable commands to issue upon selection, and showing
connections (and connectability) to a single input attribute. There are also
the abilities to add/remove/replace nodes through the command line interface,
and drag/add.

In some configurations, dragging a connected attribute of a node will load the
node at the other end of the connection.

There is a right mouse button menu and a flag to attach a command to it. The
menu is used to list the specific connections of a connected attribute.
Clicking over any spot but the row of a connected attribute will show an empty
menu. By default, there is no command attached to the menu.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

None

In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ac    : addCommand      [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command executed when the node outliner adds something. String commands use substitution of the term %node for whatever is added, eg, if you want to print the object added, the command should be "print(\"%node \\\n\")". Callable python objects are passed the node name.

-----------------------------------------

a     : addObject       [name] ['edit']
    add the given object to the display

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

aao   : attrAlphaOrder  [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specify how attributes are to be sorted. Current recognised values are "default" for no sorting and "ascend" to sort attributes from 'a' to ''z' and "descend" to sort from 'z' to 'a'. Notes: a) this only applies to top level attributes.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

c     : connectivity    [name] ['query', 'edit']
    Takes an attribute argument ("nodeName.attributeName"), dims any attributes that can't connect to the given, and highlights any attributes already connected

-----------------------------------------

cs    : currentSelection [boolean] ['query']
    Retruns a string array containing what is currently selected

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

h     : height          [int] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

lcn   : lastClickedNode [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a string with the last clicked node

-----------------------------------------

lmc   : lastMenuChoice  [string] ['query']
    Returns the text of the most recent menu selection.

    Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user- friendly, readable way. When this is on, the longNames flag is ignored. When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

outlinerEditor is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates an outliner editor which can be used to display a list of
objects.  
WARNING: some flag combinations may not behave as you expect. The command is
really intended for internal use for creating the outliner used by the various
editors.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  (the name of the editor)    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------

ams   : allowMultiSelection [boolean] ['edit']
    If true then multiple selection will be allowed in the outliner.

-----------------------------------------

ats   : alwaysToggleSelect [boolean] ['edit']
    If true, then clicking on an item in the outliner will select or deselect it without affecting the selection of other items (unless allowMultiSelection is false). If false, clicking on an item in the outliner will replace the current selection with the selected item.

-----------------------------------------

alf   : animLayerFilterOptions [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies whether a filter is to be applied when displaying animation layers. If so, the options can be "allAffecting" (no filter), "active" (only the active layers on the object will be displayed) and "animLayerEditor" (the settings will be taken from the animation layer editor).

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

ds    : directSelect    [boolean] ['edit']
    If true then clicking on an item in the outliner will add or remove just that item from the selection connection. If false then clicking on an item in the outliner causes the selection connection to be reloaded with the currently selected items in the outliner.

-----------------------------------------

dm    : displayMode     [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Affects how the outliner displays when a filter is applied. List mode is a non-indented flat list. DAG mode indents to represent the hierarchical structure of the model.

-----------------------------------------

fmc   : forceMainConnection [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object that the editor will use as its source of content. The editor will only display items contained in the selectionConnection object. This is a variant of the -mainListConnection flag in that it will force a change even when the connection is locked. This flag is used to reduce the overhead when using the -unlockMainConnection , -mainListConnection, -lockMainConnection flags in immediate succession.

-----------------------------------------

gcs   : getCurrentSetOfItem [int] ['query']
    Returns the current set of item at the given row. As an item can belong to number of sets, current set is the set to which the item belongs to currently.

-----------------------------------------

ha    : highlightActive [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    This flag specifies whether or not the outliner should highlight objects that are active. Note: if the outliner is driving the contents of another editor, setting highlightActive to true may produce unexpected behavior.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

iha   : ignoreHiddenAttribute [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets whether or not the outliner ignores the 'hidden in outliner' flag on nodes.

-----------------------------------------

ioc   : ignoreOutlinerColor [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets whether or not the outliner ignores the 'use outliner color' flag on nodes.

-----------------------------------------

ics   : isChildSelected [name] ['query']
    This flag allows you to query if one or more of the children of the specified item is selected in the outliner. The item should be specified using a unique DAG path. Note that if the specified item appears multiple times in the outliner, the result will be true if one or more children of any occurrence of the specified item in the outliner is/are selected.

-----------------------------------------

isSet : isSet           [int] ['query']
    Returns true if the item present at the given row is a set.

-----------------------------------------

ism   : isSetMember     [int] ['query']
    Returns true if the item present at the given row is a set member.

-----------------------------------------

lck   : lockMainConnection [boolean] ['edit']
    Locks the current list of objects within the mainConnection, so that only those objects are displayed within the editor. Further changes to the original mainConnection are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

ln    : longNames       [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface. Note that this flag is ignored if the -niceNames flag is set. Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.

    Sets whether or not we replace the motion trail in the outliner with the object it is trailing.

-----------------------------------------

mst   : masterOutliner  [string] ['query', 'edit']
    This flag is the name of an outliner that this outliner will share the objects and state from. When an outliner is shared, all of its state information comes from, and is applied to, the master outliner.

-----------------------------------------

nn    : niceNames       [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user- friendly, readable way. When this is on, the longNames flag is ignored. When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.

-----------------------------------------

obj   : object          [name] ['query']
    This flags is used together with the parentObject flag to get the name of the parent object for the specified object.

-----------------------------------------

obc   : organizeByClip  [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If true then when a node with Time Editor clips is displayed, attributes will be displayed according to the clip(s) it belongs to. eg: Clip1 Attr1 Attr2 Clip2 Attr1 If it is false then the outliner will be organized primarily by attributes. eg: Attr1 Clip1 Clip2 Attr2 Clip1

-----------------------------------------

obl   : organizeByLayer [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If true then when a node with animation layer is displayed, attributes will be displayed according to the layer(s) it belongs to. eg: Layer1 Attr1 Attr2 Layer2 Attr1 If it is false then the outliner will be organized primarily by attributes. eg: Attr1 Layer1 Layer2 Attr2 Layer1

-----------------------------------------

pnl   : panel           [string] ['query']
    Specifies the panel for this editor. By default if an editor is created in the create callback of a scripted panel it will belong to that panel. If an editor does not belong to a panel it will be deleted when the window that it is in is deleted.

-----------------------------------------

Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bk    : back            [boolean] []
    Go back a page

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

attrColorSliderGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

Create a color slider group consisting of a label, a color canvas, a slider
and a button. Clicking on the canvas will bring up the color editor. If the
button is visible, it will allow you to map a texture to the attribute.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

-----------------------------------------

attrFieldGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, plus two to four
float fields. These fields will be attached to the specified vector attribute,
so that changes in either will be reflected in the other.

The fields created here are expression fields -- while normally operating as a
float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the character
"-".

The field also has an automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button. The
contents of this menu change depending on the state of the attribute being
watched by the field.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The full name of the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

l     : label           [string] ['query', 'edit']
    By default, the label of this field will be the name of the attribute. This flag can be used to override that name with whatever the user wants.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Manage state of the control. An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate. All controls are created managed by default.

    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

nf    : numberOfFields  [int] []
    sets the number of fields. Only allowed values are 2 to 4. If not specified, defaults to 3. NOTE: if the -at flag is used when this widget is created, the number of children in the attribute will determine the number of fields. Also note: after creation, the number of fields cannot be changed with the -e flag.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

attrFieldSliderGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, float field and
float slider (for values with a min or max specified) The group also supports
the notion of a larger secondary range of possible field values.

If an attribute is specified for this object, then it will use any min and max
values defined in the attribute. The user-specified values can reduce the min
and max, but cannot expand them.

The field created here is an expression field -- while normally operating as a
float field, the user can type in any expression starting with the character
"=". This will expand the field to occupy the space previously taken by the
slider.

The field also has an automatic menu brought up by the right mouse button. The
contents of this menu change depending on the state of the attribute being
watched by the field.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/attrNavigationControlGrp.html



-----------------------------------------

attrNavigationControlGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged label navigation button.

The group is used to help the user manage connections to a particular
attribute.

When creating the control you have the opportunity to attach scripts to the
control that are executed on various UI events. You can define what happens
when the navigation button is pressed, and when a node is dragged and dropped
onto this attribute.

The navigation button can traverse to the connected node or can bring up UI to
create new connections to the attribute. The button also can show you state
information: if there already exists a connection/if the connection is
ignored.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

    The script to execute when a connection should be made to an existing node.

-----------------------------------------

cn    : createNew       [script] ['query', 'edit']
    The script to execute when a new "connection" is requested.

-----------------------------------------

dtv   : defaultTraversal [script] ['query', 'edit']
    The script to execute to find out the name of the default traversal node. The script you attach should be able to take in one argument (the attribute) and return the name of the node that is the default traversal node.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

delete : delete          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    The script to execute when the connection (and the node connected to) should be deleted.

-----------------------------------------

d     : disconnect      [script] ['query', 'edit']
    The script to execute when a "disconnection" is requested.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

channelBox is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a channel box, which is sensitive to the active list. It
displays certain attributes (channels) of the last node on the active list,
and provides a two-way connection to keep the widget up to date.

Note: when setting the color of attribute names, that color is only valid for
its current Maya session; each subsequent session will display the default
color for the attribute name(s) listed in the Channel Box. Any subsequent
attributes that are added to the Channel Box will be affected by prior regular
expressions in their current Maya session.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  (the name of the new channel box)    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bc    : attrBgColor     [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    Controls the background text color of specific attribute names. As with the foreground option, this text coloring also depends on the node name choice for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*" for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed will have their node name coloring be affected in the channel box.

-----------------------------------------

ac    : attrColor       [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    Controls the foreground text color of specific attribute names. This text coloring also depends on the node name choice for the nodeRegex flag. Arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*" for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. Note: nodes that are renamed will have their node name coloring be affected in the channel box.

-----------------------------------------

af    : attrFilter      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the name of an itemFilter object to be placed on the channel box. This filters the attributes displayed. A filter of "0" can be used to reset the filter.

-----------------------------------------

ar    : attrRegex       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which attribute names should be selected for foreground text coloring. If attrRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*" for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag nodeRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this regular expression will be treated as though it were case-insensitve

-----------------------------------------

aem   : attributeEditorMode [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Modifies what appears in the channel box for use in the attribute editor. Default is false. Queried, returns a boolean.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

cat   : containerAtTop  [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    This flag can be used to specify whether or not the container is drawn at the top of the channel box when a node in the container is selected.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

els   : enableLabelSelection [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the selection of attributes in the channelBox when used in conjunction with -attributeEditorMode. Default is false. Queried, returns a boolean.

-----------------------------------------

exe   : execute         [[string, boolean]] ['edit']
    Immediately executes the command string once for every cell (or every selected cell, if the boolean argument is TRUE) in the channel box, for every matching selected object (ie, for every object would be affected if you changed a cell value.) Before the command is executed, "#A" is substituted with the name of the attribute, and "#N" with the name of the node, and "#P" with the full path name of the node.

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fw    : fieldWidth      [int] ['query', 'edit']
    An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to fields appearing in the channelBox.

-----------------------------------------

fal   : fixedAttrList   [string[]] ['query', 'edit']
    Forces the channel box to only display attributes with the specified names, in the order they are specified. If an empty list is specified, then the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of listing all keyable attributes.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

hol   : historyObjectList [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a list of strings, the names of every INPUT node associated with an object on the main object list that is of the same type as the node displayed in the INPUT section of the channel box.

-----------------------------------------

hyp   : hyperbolic      [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Determines whether or not the distance that the mouse has been dragged should be interpreted as a linear or hyperbolic function. The default is set to hyperbolic being false.

-----------------------------------------

inputs : inputs          [boolean] ['query']
    Returns the items shown under the 'INPUTS' heading in the channel box.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

lw    : labelWidth      [int] ['query', 'edit']
    An optional flag which is used to modify the width assigned to labels appearing in the channelBox.

-----------------------------------------

ln    : longNames       [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Controls whether long or short attribute names will be used in the interface. Note that this flag is ignored if the -niceNames flag is set. Default is short names. Queried, returns a boolean.

-----------------------------------------

mlc   : mainListConnection [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the name of a selectionConnection object which the editor will use as its source of content. The channel box will only display the (last) item contained in the selectionConnection object. If a NULL string ("") is specified, then the channel box will revert to its default behaviour of working on the active list.

-----------------------------------------

mol   : mainObjectList  [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a list of strings, the names of every object on the active list that is the same type as the object displayed in the top (main) section of the channel box.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Manage state of the control. An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate. All controls are created managed by default.

-----------------------------------------

mh    : maxHeight       [int] ['query', 'edit']
    An optional flag which is used to limit the height of the channelBox.

-----------------------------------------

mw    : maxWidth        [int] ['query', 'edit']
    An optional flag which is used to limit the width of the channelBox.

-----------------------------------------

nn    : niceNames       [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Controls whether the attribute names will be displayed in a more user- friendly, readable way. When this is on, the longNames flag is ignored. When this is off, attribute names will be displayed either long or short, according to the longNames flag. Default is on. Queried, returns a boolean.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

nr    : nodeRegex       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies a valid regular expression to specify which node names should (potentially) have their attributes selected for foreground text coloring. If nodeRegex is unspecified then it will assume a value of "*' for a regular expression. The same idea simultaneously applies to the flag attrRegex. The attrColor flag is required to be specified. Note: this regular expression will be treated as though it were case-insensitve Note: nodes in namespaces have regular expressions applied as though those nodes weren't in namespaces

-----------------------------------------

npm   : numberOfPopupMenus [boolean] ['query']
    Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

-----------------------------------------

ool   : outputObjectList [boolean] ['query']

-----------------------------------------

po    : preventOverride [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.

-----------------------------------------

s     : select          [string] ['edit']
    Allows programmatic selection of items (nodes or plugs) in the channel box. Selection is equivalent to clicking the item with the mouse; therefore only items currently shown in the channel box can be selected this way.

-----------------------------------------

sha   : selectedHistoryAttributes [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a list of strings, the names of all the selected attributes in the INPUT section of the channel box.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

spd   : speed           [float] ['query', 'edit']
    Controls the speed at which the attributes are changed based on the distance the mouse has been dragged. Common settings for slow/medium/fast are 0.1/1.0/10.0 respectively. The default is 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

sbm   : statusBarMessage [string] ['edit']
    Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.

-----------------------------------------

tf    : takeFocus       [boolean] ['edit']

-----------------------------------------

mnp   : useManips       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    When you click on a field or label in the channel box, the tool switches to a manipulator that can change that value if you drag in the 3d view. This flag controls the kind of manips. Allowed values are "none" (self- explanatory), "invisible" (you won't see anything, but dragging in the window will adjust any of the selected attributes), and "standard" (the same as invisible, except for scale, rotate, and translate, which will be represented by their usual manips.)

-----------------------------------------

ut    : useTemplate     [string] []
    Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

-----------------------------------------

vis   : visible         [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The visible state of the control. A control is created visible by default. Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).

-----------------------------------------

vcc   : visibleChangeCommand [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

-----------------------------------------

w     : width           [int]

checkBox is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a check box. A check box is a simple control containing a
text label and a state of either on or off. Commands can be attached to any or
all of the following events: when the check box is turned on, turned off, or
simply when it's state is changed.

    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

cc    : changeCommand   [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command executed when the check box's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the check box from inside the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

ed    : editable        [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The edit state of the check box. By default, this flag is set to true and the check box value may be changed by clicking on it. If false then the check box is 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the check box can always be changed with the -v/value flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

checkBoxGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates from one to four check boxes in a single row. They can
have an optional text label.

    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

ed    : editable        [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

If false then the check boxes are 'read only' and can not be clicked on. The value of the check boxes can always be changed with the -v/value flags regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

cmdShell is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a scrolling field that behaves similar to a unix shell
for entering user input. You may specify the number of lines that will be
remembered by the field with the -nsl/numberOfSavedLines flag. The default
number of lines saved is 100. The shellField also maintains a command history
buffer. You can specify the number of input lines that will be saved with the
-hlc/historyLineCount flag. The default size of this buffer is 10.

By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

colorIndexSliderGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a color slider group consisting of a label, a color
canvas and a slider. The value of the slider defines a color index into the a
color table. The corresponding color is displayed in the canvas.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

l     : label           [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Label text for the group.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

colorSliderButtonGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command object creates a new color slider group with a button and a
symbol button. This control is primarily used in the rendering UI. In this
context, the button brings up a dialog that allows the user to assign a
texture map to this parameter. Once a texture map is available, a symbol
button shows up. When this symbol button is pressed, the user is taken to
another dialog to edit the texture map.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

colorSliderGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a color Slider group consisting of a label, a color
canvas and a slider. Clicking on the canvas will bring up the color editor
dialog.

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.

    Command string executed when slider value marker is dragged.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']

The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

componentBox is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a component box, which is sensitive to the active list.
It displays certain components of the last node on the active list, and
provides a two-way connection to keep the widget up to date.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  (the name of the new component box)    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers".

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator.

exe   : execute         [[string, boolean]] ['edit']
    Immediately executes the command string once for every cell (or every selected cell, if the boolean argument is TRUE) in the component box, for every matching selected object (ie, for every object would be affected if you changed a cell value.) Before the command is executed, "#A" is substituted with the name of the attribute, and "#N" with the name of the node, and "#P" with the full path name of the node.

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

falloffCurveAttr is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a control for editing a 2D control curve. This control
attaches to a curve attribute, which must be a multi attribute where each
entry is a compound composed of:

  1. A single float for control point position
  2. A single float for control point value

The MEL command AEaddCurveControl should be used to attach this control to an
attribute in the attribute editor templates.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The name of the port created or modified    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------

    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.

-----------------------------------------

floatFieldGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text and editable
float fields. The label text is optional and one to four float fields can be
created.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dc    : dragCommand     [script] ['edit']
    Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

floatSlider is undoable, queryable, and editable.

Create a slider control that accepts only float values and is bound by a
minimum and maximum value. The slider displays a marker indicating the current
value of the slider relative to its minimum and maximum values. Click and drag
the marker, or on the slider itself to change the current value.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

cc    : changeCommand   [script] ['edit']
    Command executed when the value changes. This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dc    : dragCommand     [script] ['edit']
    Command executed when the value changes by dragging the slider's value marker.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

    Upper limit of the slider.

-----------------------------------------

min   : minValue        [float] ['query', 'edit']
    Lower limit of the slider.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

floatSlider2 is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a float slider containing two handles. The two handles
are arranged such that they cannot pass one another, thus handle 1 will always
have a value less than or or equal to handle 2 when you adjust the values.
Each handle may have a MEL command associated with it which is issued when the
handle moves and thus can be used to update the values of plugs such as via a
setAttr command. Each handle can also be associated with a float textfield to
display the current value of the handle.

Note: the floatSlider2 widget currently only supports vertical (columnLayout)
orientation.

floatSliderButtonGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a float slider component with optional button and symbol
buttons.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dc    : dragCommand     [script] ['edit']
    Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/floatSliderGrp.html



-----------------------------------------

floatSliderGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
text, an float field and a float slider. The text and field controls are
optional. Editing or querying the field range values has no effect if the
-f/field flag was not specified when the group was created.

This group also allows you to enter values into the field outside of the
slider range which is limited by the -min/minValue and -max/maxValue flags. To
do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValue and -fmx/fieldMaxValue flags to specify a
greater range of values.

Note that the command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValue
greater than the -min/minValue value nor a -fmx/fieldMaxValue less than the
-max/maxValue value.

If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValue and
-fmx/fieldMaxValue flags then you will notice that entering a value in the
field that is outside of the slider range will result in extending the slider
range as well. For example, if you create a slider group with the following
command:

    
    
    floatSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100;
    

Then you will be able to use the slider to select any value from -10 to 10. At
the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to
100. If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such
that this value is now accessible through the slider as well. In fact, the new
slider limit will become double of that what you entered. Note that the slider
limits will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered
the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the field limit of 100 and not
doubled to 160.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name of the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dc    : dragCommand     [script] ['edit']
    Command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']

The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

gradientControl is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a control that displays the gradient attribute specified.
The gradient attribute must be of the correct form and naming. It should be a
multi attribute with each entry a compound composed of:

  1. Either a color compound or a float value (the control will automatically detect which and display a ramp or graph accordingly).
  2. A single float attribute for position.
  3. An enum for the interpolation types.

Currently the routines to get the value of a ramp structure (with
interpolation) are not available through MEL, which limits the use of this
control by end users. The MEL command AEaddRampControl should be used to
attach this control to an attribute from attribute editor templates.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The name of the port created or modified    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

adaptiveScaling : adaptiveScaling [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Allow the ramp widget display to scale vertically to accommodate values greater than 1.0. True if adaptive scaling is enabled, false (the default) if not.

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

at    : attribute       [name] []
    Specifies the name of the gradient attribute to control.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument.

Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

h     : height          [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The height of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Manage state of the control. An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate. All controls are created managed by default.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/hudButton.html



-----------------------------------------

hudButton is NOT undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) button control which is placed
in a 2D inactive overlay plane on the 3D viewport. It is to be used to provide
hands-on interaction designated by a user script. The HUD button is derived
from a generic HUD object and thus inherits a similar workflow.

Although this command provides much of the same functionality as the
headsUpDisplay command, it does not provide headsUpDisplay layout controls
such as layoutVisibility, nextFreeBlock, lastOccupiedBlock, exists, remove,
etc. To access that functionality, please use the headsUpDisplay command. This
command is focused solely around the creation and management of HUD button
controls. Similarly, all operations performed by this command are limited to
HUDs that are button controls.

The only mandatory flags, on creation are the section and block flags.

Like the headsUpDisplay command, upon creation of a HUD button, an ID number
will be assigned to it. This can be used to remove the HUD via the
headsUpDisplay command (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if desired.
Alternatively, the headsUpDisplay command can remove HUD objects via their
position (section and block), or their unique name.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

int  ID number of the Heads-Up Display (HUD).    
string int int[2]  HUD name, HUD ID or Section and block value, for respective
remove commands.  
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ao    : allowOverlap    [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag description for more details).

-----------------------------------------

b     : block           [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable.  The number of blocks that will be visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need.  For HUD buttons, the format differs from that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding, buttonWidth) is shown below:                 __________________________________     |     |     |          |     |     |     |  P  |  J  |  Button  |  J  |  P  |     |_____|_____|__________|_____|_____|     P = Sub-block of width, padding     J = Justification of the entire block     Button = Sub-block of width, buttonWidth       Block Positioning  Blocks on the top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport.  Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.

-----------------------------------------

ba    : blockAlignment  [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: "center", "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".

-----------------------------------------

bs    : blockSize       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.

-----------------------------------------

bsh   : buttonShape     [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the shape of the button. Available button shapes are: "rectangle" and "roundRectangle". The first will draw a rectangular button, while the latter is a rectangle with rounded edges.

-----------------------------------------

bw    : buttonWidth     [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the width of the button.

-----------------------------------------

l     : label           [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Text label of the HUD button.

-----------------------------------------

lfs   : labelFontSize   [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the font size of the label. Available sizes are: small and large.

-----------------------------------------

p     : padding         [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.

-----------------------------------------

pc    : pressCommand    [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse click event.

-----------------------------------------

rc    : releaseCommand  [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the procedure or script to run during a mouse release event.

-----------------------------------------

s     : section         [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.                 ________________________     |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |     | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |     |    |    |    |    |    |     |____|____|____|____|____|     |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |     | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |     |    |    |    |    |    |     |____|____|____|____|____|  Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1  To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains.  For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority.  This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.

-----------------------------------------

vis   : visible         [boolean]
    Sets the visibility of the Heads-Up Display on and off.

-----------------------------------------

hudSliderButton is NOT undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) slider button control which is
placed in a 2D inactive overlay plane on the 3D viewport. It is to be used to
provide hands-on interaction designated by a user script. The HUD slider
button control is derived from a generic HUD object and thus inherits a
similar workflow.

Although this command provides much of the same functionality as the
headsUpDisplay command, it does not provide headsUpDisplay layout controls
such as layoutVisibility, nextFreeBlock, lastOccupiedBlock, exists, remove,
etc. To access that functionality, please use the headsUpDisplay command. This
command is focused solely around the creation and management of HUD slider
button controls. Similarly, all operations performed by this command are
limited to HUDs that are slider button controls.

The only mandatory flags, on creation are the section and block flags.

Like the headsUpDisplay command, upon creation of a HUD slider button, an ID
number will be assigned to it. This can be used to remove the HUD slider via
the headsUpDisplay command (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if desired.
Alternatively, the headsUpDisplay command can remove HUD objects via their
position (section and block), or their unique name.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

int  ID number of the Heads-Up Display (HUD).    
string int int[2]  HUD name, HUD ID or Section and block value, for respective
remove commands.  
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ao    : allowOverlap    [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag description for more details).

-----------------------------------------

b     : block           [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable.  The number of blocks that will be visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need.  For HUD sliders, the format differs from that of the standard HUD. The layout using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding, labelWidth, valueWidth) is shown below:                __________________________________________________________________________     |     |     |      |           |      |       |      |        |     |     |     |  P  |  J  |  LW  |  Slider   |  IP  | Value |  IP  | Button |  J  |  P  |     |_____|_____|______|___________|______|_______|______|________|_____|_____|     P = Sub-block of width, padding     J = Justification of the entire block     LW = Sub-block of width, labelWidth     Slider = Length of the slider     SliderValue = Sub-block of width, valueWidth     Button = Sub-block of width, buttonWidth     IP = Internal Padding       Block Positioning  Blocks on the top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport.  Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.

-----------------------------------------

ba    : blockAlignment  [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: "center", "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".

-----------------------------------------

bs    : blockSize       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.

-----------------------------------------

bl    : buttonLabel     [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Text label of the HUD button.

-----------------------------------------

bfs   : buttonLabelFontSize [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the font size of the button label. Available sizes are: small and large.

-----------------------------------------

bpc   : buttonPressCommand [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the procedure or script to run during a button mouse click event.

-----------------------------------------

brc   : buttonReleaseCommand [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the procedure or script to run during a button mouse release event.

-----------------------------------------

bsh   : buttonShape     [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the shape of the button. Available button shapes are: "rectangle" and "roundRectangle". The first will draw a rectangular button, while the latter is a rectangle with rounded edges.

-----------------------------------------

bw    : buttonWidth     [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the width of the button.

-----------------------------------------

dp    : decimalPrecision [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are 1 to 8.

-----------------------------------------

ip    : internalPadding [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the amount of padding between the internal elements of the HUD. For the hudSlider, this represents the padding between the slider bar and the slider value. The default padding is 10.

-----------------------------------------

max   : maxValue        [float] ['query', 'edit']
    Specify the maximum value of the slider. Note: Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is "int", the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.

-----------------------------------------

min   : minValue        [float] ['query', 'edit']
    Specify the minimum value of the slider. Note: Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is "int", the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.

-----------------------------------------

p     : padding         [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.

-----------------------------------------

s     : section         [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.                 ________________________     |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |     | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |     |    |    |    |    |    |     |____|____|____|____|____|     |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |     | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |     |    |    |    |    |    |     |____|____|____|____|____|  Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1  To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains.  For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority.  This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.

-----------------------------------------

sdc   : sliderDragCommand [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the procedure or script to run during a slider mouse drag event.

-----------------------------------------

si    : sliderIncrement [float] ['query', 'edit']
    Specify the number of increments along the slider. If not specified or set to 0 or less, the slider will be linearly even and continuous from minValue to maxValue. Note: Although this flag takes in a FLOAT as an argument, if the HUD type is "int", the value will be automatically converted internally to an integer.

-----------------------------------------

sl    : sliderLabel     [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Text label of the HUD slider.

-----------------------------------------

sfs   : sliderLabelFontSize [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the font size of the slider label. Available sizes are: small and large.

-----------------------------------------

slw   : sliderLabelWidth [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the pixel width of the virtual "textbox" which will hold the label. The contents of this "textbox" will be left justified. If the width of the actual label exceeds the width of the "textbox," the label will be truncated to fit within the dimensions of the "textbox." (To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)

-----------------------------------------

iconTextButton is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles. The
icon image displayed is the one that best fits the current size of the control
given its current style.

This command creates an iconTextButton that can be displayed with different
icons, with or without accompanying text label. When an argument is passed, it
is used to give a name to the iconTextButton.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The name of the iconTextButton.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

al    : align           [string] ['query', 'edit']
    The label alignment. Alignment values are "left", "right", and "center". By default, the label is aligned "center". Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

c     : command         [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command executed when the control is pressed.

-----------------------------------------

rpt   : commandRepeatable [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Set if the MEL command specified in the command flag should be repeatable or not. The "g" key, by default, is the shortcut to repeat the last executed command.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

di    : disabledImage   [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dcc   : doubleClickCommand [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command executed when the control is double clicked.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

lt    : ltVersion       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    This flag is used to specify the Maya LT version that this control feature was introduced, if the version flag is not specified, or if the version flag is specified but its argument is different. This value is only used by Maya LT, and otherwise ignored. The argument should be given as a string of the version number (e.g. "2013", "2014"). Currently only accepts major version numbers (e.g. 2013 Ext 1, or 2013.5 should be given as "2014").

-----------------------------------------

iconTextCheckBox is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This control supports up to 3 icon images and 4 different display styles. The
icon image displayed is the one that best fits the current size of the control
given its current style.

This command creates an iconTextCheckBox.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

al    : align           [string] ['query', 'edit']
    The label alignment. Alignment values are "left", "right", and "center". By default, the label is aligned "center". Currently only available when -st/style is set to "iconAndTextCentered".

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

cc    : changeCommand   [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with onCommand and offCommand. That is, one should either use changeCommand and test the state of the control from inside the callback, or use onCommand and offCommand as separate callbacks.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

di    : disabledImage   [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Image used when the button is disabled. Image size must be the same as the image specified with the i/image flag. This is a Windows only flag.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

    Specify the command to be executed when an item is double clicked.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dfv   : dragFeedbackVisible [boolean] ['edit']
    Should the drag feedback be shown in the scrollbar?

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

drc   : dropRectCallback [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site. It returns the shape of the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y)  The return value is an array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn, followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.

image is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a static image for non-xpm files. Any image file format
supported by the file texture node is supported by this command.

Return Value:

string  The name of the image created.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

h     : height          [int] ['query', 'edit']

    Sets the image given the file name.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

intField is undoable, queryable, and editable.

Create a field control that accepts only integer values and is bound by a
minimum and maximum value. An invisible slider is attached to the field and
accessed by holding down the Ctrl modifier key while pressing one of the mouse
buttons. Dragging the invisible slider to the right with the middle mouse
button increases the field value by the amount specified with the -s/step
flag, while dragging to the left decreases the value by the same amount. The
left and right mouse buttons apply a factor of 0.1 and 10 to the step value.

-----------------------------------------

intFieldGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text and editable
integer fields. The label text is optional and one to four fields can be
created.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

    Command string executed when dragging the invisible slider in any of the fields.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

intSliderGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of controls containing a label
text, an integer field and an integer slider. The text and field controls are
optional. Editing or querying the field range values has no effect if the
-f/field flag was not specified when the group was created.

This group also allows you to enter values into the field outside of the
slider range which is limited by the -min/minValue and -max/maxValue flags. To
do this, use the -fmn/fieldMinValue and -fmx/fieldMaxValue flags to specify a
greater range of values.

Note that the command will not allow you to specify a -fmn/fieldMinValue
greater than the -min/minValue value nor a -fmx/fieldMaxValue less than the
-max/maxValue value.

If you do supply a larger field range with the -fmn/fieldMinValue and
-fmx/fieldMaxValue flags then you will notice that entering a value in the
field that is outside of the slider range will result in extending the slider
range as well. For example, if you create a slider group with the following
command:

    
    
    intSliderGrp -min -10 -max 10 -fieldMinValue -100 -fieldMaxValue 100;
    

Then you will be able to use the slider to select any value from -10 to 10. At
the same time you will be able to enter into the field any value from -100 to
100. If you enter a value, say 20, then the new slider range will grow such
that this value is now accessible through the slider as well. In fact, the new
slider limit will become double of that what you entered. Note that the slider
limits will never grow beyond the field limits, in other words if you entered
the value 80 then the slider will be clipped to the field limit of 100 and not
doubled to 160.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dc    : dragCommand     [script] ['edit']
    The command string executed repeatedly during a drag of the slider.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

f     : field           [boolean] []
    If true on creation the group will have an editable int field present that reflects the value of the slider.

-----------------------------------------

fmx   : fieldMaxValue   [int] ['query', 'edit']

    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dcc   : doubleClickCommand [script] ['edit']
    Set the command to call on a double click.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

    Add a VNN (Virtual Node Network) item to the control. The arguments are: item-path, icon-path, vnn-string, vnn-action. Where item-path is the path from the root of the tree to the item's name, icon-path is the icon displayed in the results list, vnn-string is used for drag data when MMB dragging the item and vnn-action is the script which is executed when the item is LMB clicked. The vnn-string should be comprised of: 'VNN runtime,VNN library,VNN node', where the VNN library can contain sub-libraries, using / to separate.

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

progressBar is undoable, queryable, and editable.

Creates a progress bar control that graphically fills in as its progress value
increases.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

bp    : beginProgress   [boolean] ['edit']
    Only valid for the main progress bar   Shows the main progress bar (normally in the Help Line). This is normally issued through MEL when a length computation is about to occur.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ep    : endProgress     [boolean] ['edit']
    Only valid for the main progress bar   Hides the progress bar. No other flags can be used at the same time. This is normally issued through MEL in response to the -ic/isCancelled flag being set or if the progress value reaches its maximum.

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

h     : height          [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The height of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

ic    : isCancelled     [boolean] ['query']
    Returns true if the user has tried to cancel the operation. Returns false otherwise.

-----------------------------------------

ii    : isInterruptable [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Only valid for the main progress bar      Returns true if the isCancelled flag should respond to attempts to cancel the operation. Setting this to true will add a note in the help line display message to the user indicating that they can cancel the operation.

-----------------------------------------

imp   : isMainProgressBar [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Determines whether this progressBar is used to show the progress of all basic operations such as Open/Save file.  The main progressBar behaves very differently, in that it only shows itself when there is an ongoing basic operation.  Defaults to false, and only one progress bar will be recognized as the "main" one.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Manage state of the control. An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate. All controls are created managed by default.

-----------------------------------------

max   : maxValue        [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The maximum or "ending" value of the progress indicator. If the progress value is greater than the -max/maxValue, the progress value will be set to the maximum. Default value is 100.

-----------------------------------------

min   : minValue        [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The minimum or "starting" value of the progress indicator. If the progress value is less than the -min/minValue, the progress value will be set to the minimum. Default value is 0.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

npm   : numberOfPopupMenus [boolean] ['query']
    Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

-----------------------------------------

p     : parent          [string] ['query']
    The parent layout for this control.

-----------------------------------------

pma   : popupMenuArray  [boolean] ['query']
    Return the names of all the popup menus attached to this control.

-----------------------------------------

po    : preventOverride [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.

-----------------------------------------

pr    : progress        [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The amount of progress currently shown on the control. The value will always be between min and max. Default is equal to the minimum when the control is created.

-----------------------------------------

st    : status          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Only valid for the main progress bar      Sets the contents of the helpLine control when the progressBar is showing. Use this instead of setting the helpLine directly because this will force a graphical refresh before returning.

-----------------------------------------

sbm   : statusBarMessage [string] ['edit']
    Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.

-----------------------------------------

s     : step            [int] ['edit']
    Increments the -pr/progress value by the amount specified.

-----------------------------------------

ut    : useTemplate     [string] []
    Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

-----------------------------------------

vis   : visible         [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The visible state of the control. A control is created visible by default. Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).

-----------------------------------------

vcc   : visibleChangeCommand [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

-----------------------------------------

w     : width           [int]
    The width of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

radioButtonGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates from one to four radio buttons in a single row. By
default the radio buttons will share a single collection, but they can also
share the collection of another radio button group. The buttons can also have
an optional text label.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

acc   : afterCellChangedCmd [script] ['edit']
    Sets the script to call after the value of a cell has been changed. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into that cell. The procedure does not need to return any value. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:  global proc procedureName(int $row, int $column, string $value)

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

cbc   : cellBackgroundColorCommand [script] ['edit']
    Sets the script to call when it requires the background color of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return an array of ints which is the RGB color value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:                global proc int[] procedureName(int $row, int $column) {     return {255,0,0}; // return Red as cell background color     }

-----------------------------------------

ccc   : cellChangedCmd  [script] ['edit']
    Sets the script to call when somebody has changed the value of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value was changed. The 3rd argument is the string which was entered into that cell. The procedure should return an integer value which indicates whether that value should be accepted (return 1 if yes, and 0 if no). The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:  global proc int procedureName(int $row, int $column, string $value)

-----------------------------------------

cfc   : cellForegroundColorCommand [script] ['edit']
    Sets the script to call when it requires the foreground color of a cell. The procedure is called with 2 integer arguments specifying the row and column for which the value is required. The procedure should return an array of ints which is the RGB color value for the cell. The row and column numbers passed in are 1-based (i.e. (1,1) is the upper left cell). The procedure should be of the form:                global proc int[] procedureName(int $row, int $column) {     return {0,0,0}; // return Black as Text color     }

-----------------------------------------

ci    : cellIndex       [[int, int]] ['query', 'edit']
    used with cellValue , to give the index of row and column This flag and its argument must be passed to the command before the -q flag (see examples).  In query mode, this flag needs a value.

-----------------------------------------

cv    : cellValue       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    query and set the cell value on the table by the index of row and column referred in flag -cellIndex.   In edit mode, if flag -multiEditEnabled is True and any cell is selected, the flag -cellIndex is not used and the selected cells will be changed.

-----------------------------------------

cr    : clearRow        [int] ['edit']
    Clear the contents for all the cells on the specified row. Any procedure specified by the -gcc flag will be called to populate the cleared cells The row number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).

-----------------------------------------

ct    : clearTable      [boolean] ['edit']
    Clears the contents of all the cells in the table. Any procedure specified by the -gcc flag will be called to populate the cleared cells

-----------------------------------------

cf    : columnFilter    [[int, string]] ['edit']
    Filter the specified column with the string value provided. Set filter to columns 0 will apply the filter to all columns. The filter is case insensitive and support wildcards. Wildcard Matching: Wildcard matching is much simpler than full regexps and has only four features: c Any character represents itself apart from those mentioned below. Thus c matches the character c. ? Matches any single character. It is the same as . in full regexps. * Matches zero or more of any characters. It is the same as .* in full regexps. [...] Sets of characters can be represented in square brackets, similar to full regexps. Within the character class, backslash has no special meaning. (i.e. you can search for "MyValue" with "y*u" or "??Val??" or "[MyThe]Value" or any letters in "MyValue" The column number is 1-based (i.e. the first row is 1 not 0).

-----------------------------------------

cw    : columnWidth     [[int, int]] ['edit']
    Set the width of the specified column The column number is 1-based (ie. the first column is 1 not 0).

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

symbolButton is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a symbol button. A symbol button behaves like a regular
button, the only difference is a symbol button displays an image rather that a
text label. A command may be attached to the button which will be executed
when the button is pressed.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

c     : command         [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command executed when the symbol button is pressed.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.

In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

drc   : dropRectCallback [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is hovering above the drop site. It returns the shape of the rectangle to be drawn to highlight the entry, if the control can receive the dropped data. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc int[] callbackName(string $dropControl, int $x, int $y)  The return value is an array of size 4, with the parameters, in order, being the left and top coordinates of the rectangle to be drawn, followed by the width and height. This functionality is currently only implemented in MEL.

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fn    : font            [string] ['query', 'edit']

    The height of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

hl    : hyperlink       [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the label text to be a hyperlink if the argument is true. The label text must be a proper HTML link. In MEL, double quotes in the link will most likely have to be protected from the MEL interpreter by preceding them with a backslash. Clicking on the link will open it in an external Web browser.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

l     : label           [string] ['query', 'edit']
    The label text. The default label is the name of the control.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Manage state of the control. An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate. All controls are created managed by default.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

    If true, this flag prevents overriding the control's attribute via the control's right mouse button menu.

-----------------------------------------

rs    : recomputeSize   [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If true then the control will recompute it's size to just fit the size of the label. If false then the control size will remain fixed as you change the size of the label. The default value of this flag is true.

-----------------------------------------

sbm   : statusBarMessage [string] ['edit']
    Extra string to display in the status bar when the mouse is over the control.

-----------------------------------------

ut    : useTemplate     [string] []
    Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

-----------------------------------------

vis   : visible         [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The visible state of the control. A control is created visible by default. Note that a control's actual appearance is also dependent on the visible state of its parent layout(s).

-----------------------------------------

vcc   : visibleChangeCommand [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

-----------------------------------------

w     : width           [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The width of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

ww    : wordWrap        [boolean]
    If true then label text is wrapped where necessary at word-breaks. If false, it is not wrapped at all. The default value of this flag is false.

    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dif   : drawInactiveFrame [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets whether the text field draws itself with a frame when it's inactive.   By default, this option is false.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

ed    : editable        [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The edit state of the field. By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it. If false then the field is 'read only' and can not be typed into.

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

textFieldButtonGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command adds a button to the textFieldGrp command.

    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/CommandsPython/textFieldGrp.html



-----------------------------------------

textFieldGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text and editable text
field. The label text is optional.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

-----------------------------------------

textScrollList is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates/edits/queries a text scrolling list. The list can be in
single select mode where only one item at at time is selected, or in multi-
select mode where many items may be selected.

Note: The -dgc/dragCallback flag works only on Windows.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ai    : allItems        [boolean] ['query']
    All the items.

-----------------------------------------

aas   : allowAutomaticSelection [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Specify automatic selection mode. When automaticSelection is on each item that the mouse is over (during dragging once an item has been selected) will be selected. Thus, if -sc/selectCommand someCommand is set, someCommand will be called for each selected item. If -aas/allowAutomaticSelection is off, then only the item selected when the mouse button is up will be the selected item, so -sc/selectCommand someCommand is only called once if it is set.

-----------------------------------------

ams   : allowMultiSelection [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Specify multi or single selection mode.

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

a     : append          [string] ['edit']
    Add an item to the end of the list.

-----------------------------------------

ap    : appendPosition  [[int, string]] ['edit']
    Append an item at the specified position. The position is a 1-based index.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dkc   : deleteKeyCommand [script] ['edit']
    Specify the command to be executed when the delete or backspace key is pressed.

-----------------------------------------

da    : deselectAll     [boolean] ['edit']
    Deselect all items.

-----------------------------------------

dii   : deselectIndexedItem [int] ['edit']
    Deselect the indexed item. Indices are 1-based.

-----------------------------------------

di    : deselectItem    [string] ['edit']
    Deselect the item that contains the specified text.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dcc   : doubleClickCommand [script] ['edit']
    Specify the command to be executed when an item is double clicked.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fn    : font            [string] ['query', 'edit']
    The font for the list items. Valid values are "boldLabelFont", "smallBoldLabelFont", "tinyBoldLabelFont", "plainLabelFont", "smallPlainLabelFont", "obliqueLabelFont", "smallObliqueLabelFont", "fixedWidthFont" and "smallFixedWidthFont".

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

h     : height          [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The height of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

lf    : lineFont        [[int, string]] ['edit']
    Specify the font for a specific line of the list. The indices are 1-based. Valid font values are "boldLabelFont", "smallBoldLabelFont", "tinyBoldLabelFont", "plainLabelFont", "smallPlainLabelFont", "obliqueLabelFont", "smallObliqueLabelFont", "fixedWidthFont" and "smallFixedWidthFont".

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Manage state of the control. An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate. All controls are created managed by default.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

utg   : uniqueTag       [string] ['edit']
    This flag can only be used in conjunction with the append or the appendPosition flag. The string specifies a unique tag for the appended item; the tag can then be used to query an item. This tag provides an alternate way to uniquely identify a list item using a string instead of by index. Tags are case insensitive.

-----------------------------------------

ut    : useTemplate     [string] []
    Forces the command to use a command template other than the current one.

-----------------------------------------

vis   : visible         [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

timeField is undoable, queryable, and editable.

Create a field control that accepts only time values. An invisible slider is
attached to the field and accessed by holding down the Ctrl modifier key while
pressing one of the mouse buttons. Dragging the invisible slider to the right
with the middle mouse button increases the field value by the amount specified
with the -s/step flag, while dragging to the left decreases the value by the
same amount. The left and right mouse buttons apply a factor of 0.1 and 10 to
the step value.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

cc    : changeCommand   [script] ['edit']
    Command executed when the field changes. This command is not invoked when the value changes via the -v/value flag.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dc    : dragCommand     [script] ['edit']
    Command executed when dragging in the field.

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

ed    : editable        [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The edit state of the field. By default, this flag is set to true and the field value may be changed by typing into it. If false then the field cannot be changed interactively. However, the field text can be changed using the -v/value flag regardless of the state of the -ed/editable flag.

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Manage state of the control. An unmanaged control is not visible, nor does it take up any screen real estate. All controls are created managed by default.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

timeFieldGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text and editable time
fields. The label text is optional and one to four time fields can be created.

    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

toolButton is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a toolButton that is added to the most recently created
tool button collection unless the cl/collection flag is used. It also attaches
the named tool, activating it when this control is selected.

By default, this control only handles one tool at a time. Using the t/tool
flag to associate a new tool will simply override the previous attached tool.
If you use the amt/allowMultipleTools flag then you will be able to attach
more than one tool with this control. Only one tool will be current within the
control. To access the other tools press the right mouse button to display a
popup menu containing all the tools associated with this control. If you set
the piv/popupIndicatorVisible flag then a small arrow will be drawn on the
control to indicate that additional tools are attached to this control.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The name of the toolButton created.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

amt   : allowMultipleTools [boolean] ['query']
    Indicates whether this control will allow you to attach more than one tool. By default, this control accepts only one tool. You can add multiple tools by setting this flag to true. Only one tool will be current and displayed at any one time. Use the pop up menu attached to the right mouse button to view all the tools.

-----------------------------------------

cc    : changeCommand   [script] ['edit']
    Command executed when the control's state is changed. Note that this flag should not be used in conjunction with onCommand and offCommand.

argument is the name of the control.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The name of the created control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

af    : addFavorite     [string] ['edit']
    Add an item path to the favorites folder. The item path does not have to actually be in the tree.

-----------------------------------------

add   : addItem         [[string, string, script]] ['edit']
    Add an item to the control. The arguments are item-path,icon path,command where item-path is the path from the root of the tree to the item's name icon path is the icon displayed in the results list command is the script which is executed when the item is LMB clicked

-----------------------------------------

avi   : addVnnItem      [[string, string, string, string]] ['edit']
    Add a VNN (Virtual Node Network) item to the control. The arguments are: item-path, icon-path, vnn-string, vnn-action. Where item-path is the path from the root of the tree to the item's name, icon-path is the icon displayed in the results list, vnn-string is used for drag data when MMB dragging the item and vnn-action is the script which is executed when the item is LMB clicked. The vnn-string should be comprised of: 'VNN runtime,VNN library,VNN node', where the VNN library can contain sub-libraries, using / to separate.

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

clr   : clearContents   [boolean] ['edit']
    Clears the contents of the control.

-----------------------------------------

cp    : collapsePath    [string] ['edit']
    Collapse a path in the tree.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

elc   : editLabelCommand [script] ['edit']
    Set the callback function to be invoked when the user changes the name of an item by double clicking it in the UI. The callback should accept two string arguments: the item name and the new name. The item name refers to the name of the item and not the display label. The callback function should return a string. An empty string indicates that the rename operation was invalid and the control should revert to the original name. If the rename operation is valid the callback should return a string that identifies the item, possibly different from the new display name entered by the user.

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

si    : selectItem      [[string, boolean]] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets an item's selected state. first argument specifies the item, second argument specifies selection status. When used for query without arguments, return all selected items in the treeview.

-----------------------------------------

scc   : selectionChangedCommand [script] ['edit']
    Set the callback function to be invoked when a complete selection operation triggered by the user has occurred successfully. The callback is invoked if the "selectCommand" callback has returned a non-empty value (or always there is no "selectCommand" callback). This differs from selectCommand in that a simple selection replacement will generate two callbacks with "selectCommand" (one for deselect of the old item and one for select of the new), whereas "selectionChangedCommand" will only be invoked once, after the selection is complete. The callback is not passed any parameters and does not need to return any value (i.e. It is simply a notification mechanism).

-----------------------------------------

scl   : selectionColor  [[string, float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the color an item will turn to indicate that it is selected. first parameter specifies the item three float values specify RGB values, between 0 and 1.

columnLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a layout that arranges its children in a single column.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

adj   : adjustableColumn [boolean] ['edit']
    Sets the children of the layout to be attached on both sides. They will stretch or shrink with the layout.

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

ca    : childArray      [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.

-----------------------------------------

cal   : columnAlign     [string] ['edit']

-----------------------------------------

cat   : columnAttach    [[string, int]] ['edit']
    Sets the attachment and offsets for the children of the layout. Side values: "left" | "right" | "both". Left or both is recommended.

-----------------------------------------

co    : columnOffset    [[string, int]] ['edit']
    Sets the offsets for children of the layout. Side values: "left" | "right" | "both".

-----------------------------------------

cw    : columnWidth     [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the width of the column. Unless the children are attached to both sides of the column, the width cannot be enforced. Larger children will expand layout.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

formLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a form layout control. A form layout allows absolute and
relative positioning of the controls that are its immediate children.

Controls have four edges: top, left, bottom and right. There are only two
directions that children can be positioned in, right-left and up-down. The
attach flags take the direction of an attachment from the argument that names
the edge to attach (the second argument). Any or all edges of a child may be
attached. There are six ways to attach them:

  * Attach to Form - Attaches an edge to the relevant side of the form layout. Thus -attachForm button3 "left" will attach the left edge of the button to the left edge of the form.

  * Attach to Opposite Side of Form - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side of the form layout.

  * Attach to Another Control - Attaches an edge to the closest edge of the other control named.

  * Attach to Opposite Side of Another Control - Attaches an edge relative to the furthest side of another control.

  * Attach to Position - Attaches an edge to a position on the form layout. The position is given as a fixed fraction of the -nd/numDivisions value and as this value defaults to 100 it is easiest to think of it as a percentage of the form's size.

  * Attach to Nothing - Attaches an edge to nothing. The size of the child control will determine this edge's position.

Each edge attachment may have an offset that acts to separate controls
visually.

There is no default positioning relationship so to have children appear in the
form they must have at least one edge attached in each direction.

Note: In the flag definitions the arguments follow these rules:

  * control must be the name of an immediate child of the form layout.

  * edge must be one of "top", "left", "bottom", or "right".

  * position may range from 0 to the number of divisions as specified with the -nd/numberOfDivisions flag and gives the fraction of the width of the form as a measurement. This normally means 0-100 so position may be thought of as a percentage.

  * offset is an integer value in pixels.

These are multi-use flags so any number of attachments may be made in a single
command.

Note: Avoid making control attachments that form a loop in control
dependencies. For example:

    
    
    window;
    string $form = `formLayout`;
    string $btn1 = `button`;
    string $btn2 = `button`;
    string $btn3 = `button`;  
    
    formLayout -edit  
        -attachControl $btn2 "top"   2 $btn1  
        -attachControl $btn3 "top"   2 $btn2  
        -attachControl $btn1 "right" 2 $btn3
    $form;  
    
    showWindow;
    

$btn2 is attached to $btn1, $btn3 is attached to $btn2, and $btn1 is attached
to $btn3. Thus, the placement of $btn1 is dependent on the placement of $btn3,
which is dependent on the placement of $btn2, which is dependent on the
placement of $btn1. The last control attachment will have created a loop in
the dependencies.

To prevent runtime errors, Maya will ignore this attachment and instead issue
a warning that a cyclical control attachment has been detected in the script.

frameLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates frame layout control. A frame layout may draw a border
around its child controls as well as a display a title. Frame layouts may also
be collapsable. Collapsing a frame layout will make the child of the frame
layout invisible and shrink the frame layout size. The frame layout may then
be expanded to make its child visible. Note that the frame layout may have
only one child control. If you wish to have more than one child inside a frame
layout then you must use some other control layout as the immediate child of
the frame layout.

-----------------------------------------

cll   : collapsable     [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

    Collapse state of the frame layout.

-----------------------------------------

cc    : collapseCommand [script] ['edit']
    Command executed after the frame is collapsed.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

gridLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This layout arranges children in a grid fashion where every cell in the grid
is the same size. You may specify the number of rows and columns as well as
the width and height of the grid cells.

menuBarLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

Create a layout containing a menu bar. The menu bar will appear and behave
similar to any menu bar created with the 'window -menuBar true' command. Menus
may be created with a menuBarLayout as their parent. Child controls are simply
positioned to fill the menuBarLayout area beneath the menu bar consequently,
some other layout should be used as the immediate child.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

ca    : childArray      [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

paneLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a pane layout. A pane layout may have any number of
children but at any one time only certain children may be visible, as
determined by the current layout configuration. For example a horizontally
split pane shows only two children, one on top of the other and a visible
separator between the two. The separator may be moved to vary the size of each
pane. Various other pane configurations are available and all display a
moveable separator that define the size of each pane in the layout.

-----------------------------------------

rowColumnLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a rowColumn layout. A rowColumn layout positions children
in either a row or column format. A column layout, specified with the
-nc/numberOfColumns flag, allows you set text alignment, attachments and
offsets for each column in the layout. Every member of a column will have the
same alignment, attachment and offsets. Likewise the row format, specified by
the -nr/numberOfRows flag, allows setting of these attributes for each row in
the layout. Every member of a row will have the same attributes. The layout
must be either a row or column format. This layout does not support both, or
the specification of attributes on an individual child basis.

Some flags only make sense for one of either the row format or the column
format. For example the -rh/rowHeight flag can only be specified in row
format. In column format the row height is determined by the tallest child in
the row, plus offsets.

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

scrollLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a scroll layout. A scroll layout is useful for when you
have a number of controls which cannot all be visible at a time. This layout
will display a horizontal and/or vertical scroll bar when necessary to bring
into view the hidden controls. Since the scroll layout provides no real
positioning of children you should use another control layout as the immediate
child.

    Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area. You may also indicate a minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minChildWidth flag.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

tabLayout is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a tab group. Tab groups are a specialized form of control
layouts that contain only control layouts. Whenever a control layout is added
to a tab group it will have a tab provided for it that allows selection of
that group from amongst other tabbed control groups. Only one child of a tab
layout is visible at a time.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

bs    : borderStyle     [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specify the style of the border for tab layout. Valid values are: "none", "top", "notop" and "full". By default, it will use "full" to draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout.    * "none" \- Do not draw borders around the body area of the tab layout   * "top" \- Only draw a simple line right below the tabs   * "notop" \- Draw a simple frame on the left/right/bottom (no top) of the tab layout   * "full" \- Draw a simple frame around the body area of the tab layout

-----------------------------------------

cc    : changeCommand   [script] ['edit']
    Command executed when a tab is selected interactively. This command is only invoked when the selected tab changes. Re-selecting the current tab will not invoke this command.

-----------------------------------------

ca    : childArray      [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.

-----------------------------------------

cr    : childResizable  [boolean] ['query']
    Set to true if you want the child of the control layout to be as wide as the scroll area. You may also indicate a minimum width for the child using the -mcw/minChildWidth flag.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dcc   : doubleClickCommand [script] ['edit']
    Command executed when a tab is double clicked on. Note that the first click will select the tab and the second click will execute the double click command. Double clicking the current tab will re-invoke the double click command.

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

attrEnumOptionMenuGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label and option menu button
associated with an attribute of a node. The attribute should be an integer,
and this control allows a UI association of strings to the integers of the
attribute. When a new menu item is choosen the corresponding integer will be
assigned to the attribute.

This control will automatically read the enumeration values from the attribute
if none are provided.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  The full name of the control on creation.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ei    : enumeratedItem  [[int, string]] []
    Enumerated item and the corresponding string. If this flag is not supplied when the control is created, then the command will try to read the values from the attribute.

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

l     : label           [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Text for the control.

-----------------------------------------

m     : manage          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

npm   : numberOfPopupMenus [boolean] ['query']
    Return the number of popup menus attached to this control.

-----------------------------------------

p     : parent          [string] ['query']

    Command that gets executed when visible state of the control changes.

-----------------------------------------

w     : width           [int]

The command signature should look like this: ` global proc int proc_name>(string $editorName, string $nodeName, string $plug, string $mode, string $menuType) ` The method should return 0 if it does not recognize the node type and the default attributeMenu popup menu will be displayed. If the callback returns one then the menu is considered built and no other menuItems will be added to the popup. The return value from this flag will be the ID to use for the -unregPulldownMenuCommand flag.

-----------------------------------------

upm   : unregPulldownMenuCommand [int]
    This flag will unregister a callback procedure that was registered with the -regPulldownMenuCommand flag. The argument should be the integer identifier returned from the -regPulldownMenuCommand flag.

-----------------------------------------

menuEditor is undoable, queryable, and editable.

A menuEditor displays the contents of a popup menu and allows the menu's items
to be edited. Menu items are represented by labelled icons which can be
dragged around within the editor to change the menu's layout. Various objects
can be dragged and dropped into the menuEditor to create new menu items:
toolButtons from the shelf or toolbox, shelfButtons from the shelf,
iconTextButtons with attached commands, and scripts from the command window.

When editing a Marking Menu, the radial menu items correspond to 8 icons
arranged in a circle within the menuEditor. Overflow items in the Marking Menu
(or linear items in a normal menu) are displayed in a column below the radial
items.

To edit a submenu of a popup menu, a new menuEditor instance must be created
(typically within its own window) and attached to its parent menuEditor.

Some flags require the position of a menu item to be passed in as an argument.
For these, positions are specified with a (string,int) pair, where the string
corresponds to a radial position (possibily "None") and the int corresponds to
a linear position (possibly equal to 0 for none). Radial positions are
specified by one of ("N",0), ("NE",0), ("E",0), ("SE",0), ("S",0), ("SW",0),
("W",0) or ("NW",0). Overflow, or linear positions, are specified with
("None",i), where i is a 1-based index giving the position of the item within
the overflow column.

Note: This command is not meant to be called explicitly. It was created to
support the Marking Menu editor. It is recommended that you use that editor to
modify marking menus.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

string  Full path name to the editor.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

ch    : cellHeight      [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The height of the icons in the menuEditor.

-----------------------------------------

    The width of the icons in the menuEditor.

-----------------------------------------

cwh   : cellWidthHeight [[int, int]] ['edit']
    The width and height of the icons in the menuEditor.

-----------------------------------------

cbp   : checkBoxPresent [[boolean, string, int]] ['query', 'edit']
    This controls whether a menu item has a check box or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item. If queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

-----------------------------------------

cbs   : checkBoxState   [[boolean, string, int]] ['query', 'edit']
    The state of the check box associated with a menu item. The arguments are a flag indicating state, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have a check box. If queried, an array of booleans is returned containing all the flags. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

-----------------------------------------

ca    : childArray      [boolean] ['query']
    Returns a string array of the names of the layout's immediate children.

-----------------------------------------

c     : command         [[string, string, int]] ['query', 'edit']
    The command or script executed by a menu item. The arguments are the command string or script name, followed by the position of the menu item. This flag is ignored if the menu item is a submenu item or a separator item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

d     : delete          [[string, int]] ['edit']
    Deletes the menu item at the given position, removing it from the menu. If the menu item has a submenu, and a sub-menuEditor is open and attached to it, then the sub-menuEditor's window and all its child menuEditor windows will be closed recursively.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

h     : height          [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The height of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

imc   : iconMenuCallback [string] []
    This is the name of a MEL callback procedure that is called to create the popup menus attached to icons in the menuEditor. The callback is called once for each newly created icon, and once each time an icon is moved within the menuEditor. Popup menus created by the callback should contain commands for editing the menu item associated with the icon. Operations accessible through the menu should include deletion of the item, editing of the item's label/command/image/checkbox/optionbox, creation of a submenu, and popping up a sub-menuEditor.  The arguments to the callback must match this form:  callbackProc(string $menuEditorName, string $parentIconName, string $menuTitle, string $radialPosition, int $overflowRow);  The popup menu's parent should be $parentIconName.  Note that when a sub-menuEditor is created, this flag need not be re-specified as it adopts a default value equal to the value of its parent menuEditor's -imc/iconMenuCallback flag.

-----------------------------------------

i     : image           [[string, string, int]] ['query', 'edit']
    The filename of the icon associated with a menu item. This icon is displayed by the menuEditor to represent the menu item. The arguments are the icon filename, followed by the position of the menu item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the icon filenames.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

This flag is ignored if the menu item does not have an associated option box item. If queried, an array of strings is returned containing all the commands. The first 8 entries of the array correspond to radial items (in order, "N", "NE", ... "NW"), and all later entries correspond to overflow (or linear) menu items.

-----------------------------------------

obp   : optionBoxPresent [[boolean, string, int]] ['query', 'edit']
    This controls whether a menu item has an associated option box item or not. The arguments are a flag indicating presence, followed by the position of the menu item.

Return Value:

string  Full path name to the control.    
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.

Flags:

-----------------------------------------

acc   : alwaysCallChangeCommand [boolean] ['query']
    Toggle whether to always call the change command, regardless of the change.

-----------------------------------------

ann   : annotation      [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Annotate the control with an extra string value.

-----------------------------------------

bgc   : backgroundColor [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The background color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.   When setting backgroundColor, the background is automatically enabled, unless enableBackground is also specified with a false value.

-----------------------------------------

bsp   : beforeShowPopup [script] ['edit']
    Callback that is called just before we show the drop down menu.

-----------------------------------------

cc    : changeCommand   [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a new item is selected.  The MEL script will have the newly selected item's value substituted for #1.  For Python, the callback should be a callable object which accepts one argument, which is the newly selected item's value.

-----------------------------------------

dt    : defineTemplate  [string] []
    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

-----------------------------------------

en    : enable          [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    The enable state of the control. By default, this flag is set to true and the control is enabled. Specify false and the control will appear dimmed or greyed-out indicating it is disabled.

-----------------------------------------

ebg   : enableBackground [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Enables the background color of the control.

-----------------------------------------

ekf   : enableKeyboardFocus [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    If enabled, the user can navigate to the control with the tab key and select values with the keyboard. If not, the user can only use the mouse. This flag would typically be used to turn off keyboard focus support from controls that get it by default, like Edit and List controls

-----------------------------------------

ex    : exists          [boolean] []
    Returns whether the specified object exists or not. Other flags are ignored.

-----------------------------------------

fpn   : fullPathName    [boolean] ['query']
    Return the full path name of the widget, which includes all the parents.

-----------------------------------------

h     : height          [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The height of the control. The control will attempt to be this size if it is not overruled by parent layout conditions.

-----------------------------------------

hlc   : highlightColor  [[float, float, float]] ['query', 'edit']
    The highlight color of the control. The arguments correspond to the red, green, and blue color components. Each component ranges in value from 0.0 to 1.0.

-----------------------------------------

io    : isObscured      [boolean] ['query']
    Return whether the control can actually be seen by the user. The control will be obscured if its state is invisible, if it is blocked (entirely or partially) by some other control, if it or a parent layout is unmanaged, or if the control's window is invisible or iconified.

-----------------------------------------

ill   : itemListLong    [boolean] ['query']
    The long names of the menu items.

-----------------------------------------

mvi   : maxVisibleItems [int] ['query', 'edit']
    The maximum number of items that are visible in the popup menu. If the popup contains more items than this, a scrollbar is added automatically.

-----------------------------------------

nbg   : noBackground    [boolean] ['edit']
    Clear/reset the control's background. Passing true means the background should not be drawn at all, false means the background should be drawn. The state of this flag is inherited by children of this control.

-----------------------------------------

ni    : numberOfItems   [boolean] ['query']
    The number of menu items.

-----------------------------------------

npm   : numberOfPopupMenus [boolean] ['query']

-----------------------------------------

optionMenuGrp is undoable, queryable, and editable.

All of the group commands position their individual controls in columns
starting at column 1. The layout of each control (ie. column) can be
customized using the -cw/columnWidth, -co/columnOffset, -cat/columnAttach,
-cal/columnAlign, and -adj/adjustableColumn flags. By default, columns are
left aligned with no offset and are 100 pixels wide. Only one column in any
group can be adjustable.

This command creates a pre-packaged collection of label text, option menu and
an extra label. Both the label and extra label are optional. Subsequent calls
to the menuItem command will place them in the option menu. When adding menu
items to the option menu after the initialization step, use the name of the
options menu itself. See the example below for more details. Note that
commands attached to menu items will not get called. Use the
-cc/changedCommand flag to be notified when the user changes the value of the
option menu.

    Puts the command in a mode where any other flags and arguments are parsed and added to the command template specified in the argument. They will be used as default arguments in any subsequent invocations of the command when templateName is set as the current template.

-----------------------------------------

dtg   : docTag          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Add a documentation flag to the control. The documentation flag has a directory structure. (e.g., -dt render/multiLister/createNode/material)

-----------------------------------------

dgc   : dragCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when the middle mouse button is pressed. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc string[] callbackName(string $dragControl, int $x, int $y, int $mods)  The proc returns a string array that is transferred to the drop site. By convention the first string in the array describes the user settable message type. Controls that are application defined drag sources may ignore the callback. $mods allows testing for the key modifiers CTRL and SHIFT. Possible values are 0 == No modifiers, 1 == SHIFT, 2 == CTRL, 3 == CTRL + SHIFT.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def callbackName( dragControl, x, y, modifiers ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "x", "y", "modifiers". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(x)d %(y)d %(modifiers)d'")

-----------------------------------------

dpc   : dropCallback    [script] ['edit']
    Adds a callback that is called when a drag and drop operation is released above the drop site. The MEL version of the callback is of the form:  global proc callbackName(string $dragControl, string $dropControl, string $msgs[], int $x, int $y, int $type)  The proc receives a string array that is transferred from the drag source. The first string in the msgs array describes the user defined message type. Controls that are application defined drop sites may ignore the callback. $type can have values of 1 == Move, 2 == Copy, 3 == Link.  In Python, it is similar, but there are two ways to specify the callback. The recommended way is to pass a Python function object as the argument. In that case, the Python callback should have the form:  def pythonDropTest( dragControl, dropControl, messages, x, y, dragType ):  The values of these arguments are the same as those for the MEL version above.  The other way to specify the callback in Python is to specify a string to be executed. In that case, the string will have the values substituted into it via the standard Python format operator. The format values are passed in a dictionary with the keys "dragControl", "dropControl", "messages", "x", "y", "type". The "dragControl" value is a string and the other values are integers (eg the callback string could be "print '%(dragControl)s %(dropControl)s %(messages)r %(x)d %(y)d %(type)d'")

popupMenu is undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a popup menu and attaches it to the current control if no
parent is specified. The popup menu is posted with the right mouse button by
default.

Popup menus can be added to any kind of control, however, on some widgets,
only the standard menu button (3rd mouse button) can be used to trigger popup
menus. This is to meet generally accepted UI guidelines that assign the 3rd
mouse button and only this one to popup menus, and also to prevent unexpected
behavior of controls like text fields, that expect 1st and 2nd button to be
reserved for contextual operations like text or item selection...

-----------------------------------------

saveMenu is undoable, NOT queryable, and NOT editable.

This command is used for saving the contents of a menu, so that another
instance of the menu may be recreated later. The command writes out a file
which, when run as a script, will rebuild the menuItems contained in the
original menu. Note that the fileName is relative to the user's marking menu
preference directory.

Note that this command is used solely by the Marking Menu Editor and is not
intended to be used for general purposes.

Note that this command doesn't work well with controls that have mixed mel and
python command callbacks. Also, because it saves the menu state to a mel file,
it does not work with callbacks that are python callable objects.

The first argument is the name of the manu to save, the second one is the name
of the file.

Custom hooks added by third parties are not listed.  hyperShadePanelBuildCreateMenu       This hook is called to add content to the Hypershade panel create menu. It will be called after the standard Maya node entries have been created.   This callback does not have any arguments or return values. In order to preserve the desired look in the Maya UI, these callbacks should add a menu item divider just before returning using: menuItem -divider true.  hyperShadePanelBuildCreateSubMenu       This hook is called to get a classification string for the custom renderer shading nodes, to prevent them from being listed with the standard Maya nodes.   This callback does not have any arguments.    * returns: a classification string, such as `rendernode/myrenderer`  hyperShadePanelPluginChange       This hook is called when a plugin change event (loading / unloading) has occurred to inform Maya whether the Hypershade panel needs to be rebuilt.     * classification (string): classification string belonging to a plugin node, possibly from another plugin   * changeType (string): either `loadPlugin` or `unloadPlugin`   * returns: (int) non-zero if your plugin is responsible for nodes of this classification, and a Hypershade rebuild is required  createRenderNodeSelectNodeCategories       This hook is called when the Create Render Node dialog is being constructed, and allows a third party to have their nodes selected by default. A flag of the form `-allWithMyRendererUp` is the standard form, and the selection can be set up in the tree lister in the callback.   There is no return value for this callback.    * flag (string): flag passed to the Create Render Node dialog command with the leading minus (-) removed   * treeLister (string): the tree lister widget which should be affected  For example, your callback might look like:                global proc myRendererCreateRenderNodeSelectNodeCategoriesCallback(string $flag, string $treeLister){         if($flag == "allWithMyRendererUp") {             treeLister -e -selectPath "myrenderer" $treeLister;         }     }       createRenderNodePluginChange       This hook is called when a plugin change event has occurred to decide if the Create Render Node dialog needs to be closed.     * classification (string): classification string belonging to a plugin node, possibly from another plugin   * returns: (int) non-zero if your plugin is responsible for nodes of this classification, and the Create Render Node dialog needs to be closed  renderNodeClassification       This hook is called to get a classification string for the custom renderer shading nodes. This is used to determine if a given node type belongs to a plugin renderer.   This callback does not have any arguments.    * returns: a classification string, such as `rendernode/myrenderer`  createRenderNodeCommand       This hook is called to give plugin renderers the chance to register their own command for creating their nodes from the render node treeLister and Node Editor. The callback should determine from the classification of the node type in question if it is theirs, and if so, return the appropriate command for creating new nodes of that type.     * postCommand (string): command to be run after the create command   * type (string): nodeType   * returns: (string) MEL create command  buildRenderNodeTreeListerContent       This hook is called to give plugin renderers the chance to add their content to the render node tree lister.     * renderNodeTreeLister (string): the render node tree lister   * postCommand (string): command to be run post-creation   * filterString (string): a space delimited list of filters  AETemplateCustomContent       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add content to the Attribute Editor for nodes which source AEdependNodeTemplate.     * nodeName (string): the name of the node for which the Attribute Editor is being constructed  firstConnectedShader       This hook is called to determine the primary custom shader connected to the given Shading Engine.     * nodeName (string): the name of the Shading Engine   * returns (string): the name of the custom shader if applicable  allConnectedShaders       This hook is called to determine all the shaders connected to the given Shading Engine.     * nodeName (string): the name of the Shading Engine   * returns (string): a colon separated list of the connected custom shaders (shader1:shader2:shader3)  renderLayerPresetMenu       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add presets to a renderLayer node.     * nodeName (string): the name of the renderLayer node  addBakingMenuItems       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add baking menu items to the global Render - Lighting/Shading menu.     * menuItemAnchor (string): the name of the menuItem which the new baking menu items should be inserted after.   addVertexBakingMenuItems       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add baking menu items to the global Polygon - Color menu.   addPrelightMenuItems       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add pre-lighting menu items to the global Polygon - Color Set Editor menu.   addRMBBakingMenuItems       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add baking menu items to the RMB menu.     * objectName (string): the name of the object the right mouse button event occured on.  addMayaRenderingPreferences       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add custom preferences to the Maya's Rendering Preferences section.   updateMayaRenderingPreferences       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to update custom preferences of the Maya's Rendering Preferences section.   addMayaMuscleMenuItems       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add menu items to the Maya muscle Displace menu.     * menuItemAnchor (string): the name of the menuItem which the new Maya muscle menu items should be inserted after.   addMayaMuscleShelfButtons       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add items to the Maya muscle shelves.   addBackburnerRendererMenuItems       This hook is called to give plugins a chance to add items to Maya's Backburner list of available renderers.

-----------------------------------------

headsUpDisplay is NOT undoable, queryable, and editable.

This command creates a Heads-up Display (HUD) object which is placed in a 2D
inactive overlay plane on the 3D viewport. It is to be used to provide hands-
on information designated by a user script. The text string displayed on the
viewport is formatted using the various flags of this command.

The only mandatory flags, on creation are the section and block flags. Note if
the preset OR command/trigger flags are not present, only a label will be
drawn on the viewport.

Upon creation of a HUD object, an ID number will be assigned to it. This can
be used to remove the HUD object (-rid/removeID [int IDNumber]), if desired.
Alternatively, HUD objects may be removed via their position (section and
block), or their unique name.


-----------------------------------------


Return Value:

int  ID number of the Heads-Up Display (HUD), for regular command execution.    
string int int[2]  HUD name, HUD ID or Section and block value, for respective
remove commands.  
  
In query mode, return type is based on queried flag.


-----------------------------------------


Flags:

-----------------------------------------

ad    : allDescendants  [boolean] ['edit']
    This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag. If it is specified, and the HUD is attached to a compound or multi attribute, then the HUD command will run due to changes to the specified attribute as well as changes to its descendants.

-----------------------------------------

ao    : allowOverlap    [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the Heads-Up Display to be visible regardless of overlapping section widths/limitations (see -s/section flag description for more details).

-----------------------------------------

atr   : attachToRefresh [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Attaches the command to the refresh process. The script is then run each time an idle refresh is run and updates directly following it.

-----------------------------------------

ac    : attributeChange [string] ['edit']
    Runs the command when the named attribute changes value. The string must identify both the dependency node and the particular attribute. If the dependency node is deleted, this HUD is removed (even if the deletion is undoable).

-----------------------------------------

b     : block           [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Denotes the individual block that the HUD will reside in, within a section. Each section is composed of a single column of blocks. The total number of blocks contained within each section is variable.  The number of blocks that will be visible within each section is dependent on the size of blocks contained in each section and the current size of the window. Blocks begin enumerating from 0 and flexibly increase based on need.  The resultant output string of each HUD is formatted within each block, using parameters defined by the formatting flags listed below (eg. justify, padding, labelWidth and dataWidth). The layout is shown in the following diagram:                 __________________________________________     |     |     |        |         |     |     |     |  P  |  J  |   LW   |   DWX   |  J  |  P  |     |_____|_____|________|_________|_____|_____|     P = Sub-block of width, padding     J = Justification of the entire block     LW = Sub-block of width, labelWidth     DWX = X number of sub-blocks of width, dataWidth, for X data elements.       Block Layout  The above diagram shows the layout of each block. The widths: padding, labelWidth and dataWidth are defined by their respective flags. To elaborate on the layout of the blocks, First the padding of the block is calculated. Then the two main sub-blocks (LW and DWX) in the above diagram, are justified and positioned together between the left and right margins of the block. The widths of the main sub-blocks are not variable based on it's contents. The only sub-block in the above diagram which is unique is the DWX sub-block which actually represents X number of sub-blocks, where X is the number of data elements returned by the command.  Block Positioning  Blocks on the top section begin from the top edge of the main viewport, while the bottom section begins from the bottom edge. Blocks are dynamically removed from visibility from the midpoint of the viewport. So, a relatively large block number will not draw to the viewport.  Lastly, there can be at most one HUD occupying a block at any time. Trying to position a HUD in an occupied block will result in an error. Keep this in mind when positioning the HUD.

-----------------------------------------

ba    : blockAlignment  [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the alignment of the block within its respective column. Available alignments are: "center", "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".

-----------------------------------------

bs    : blockSize       [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the height of each block. Available heights are: small, medium and large. In pixel measurements, each corresponds to a 20, 35 or 50 pixel height, respectively.

-----------------------------------------

c     : command         [script] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the procedure or script to run, in order to obtain the desired information. This must return a value or an array of values. A warning will be displayed if the command does not return a value. This flag MUST always be accompanied by a trigger flag (eg. a condition flag, an event flag, an attachToRefresh flag, etc.).

-----------------------------------------

cc    : conditionChange [string] ['edit']
    A trigger which runs the command (to sample the data), when the named condition changes. The named condition must be pre-defined or a user defined boolean. To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -lc/listConditions flag.

-----------------------------------------

cf    : conditionFalse  [string] ['edit']
    A trigger which runs the command (to sample the data), when the named condition becomes false. The named condition must be pre-defined or a user defined boolean. To get a list of what conditions exist, use the -lc/listConditions flag.

-----------------------------------------

ct    : conditionTrue   [string] ['edit']

-----------------------------------------

con   : connectionChange [string] ['edit']
    Runs the command when the named attribute changes its connectivity. The string must identify both the dependency node and the particular attribute. If the dependency node is deleted, this HUD is removed (even if the deletion is undoable).

-----------------------------------------

da    : dataAlignment   [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the alignment of the data blocks and the data text, within a HUD block. Available alignments are: "left" and "right". The default alignment is "left".

-----------------------------------------

dw    : dataWidth       [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the pixel width of the virtual "textbox" which will hold a data value. For commands which return more than one value (ie. arrays), one of these "textboxes" will be created for each data element, each with this specified width. If the width of the data value exceeds the width of the "textbox", the data value will be truncated to fit within the dimensions of the "textbox." (To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)

-----------------------------------------

dp    : decimalPrecision [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the decimal precision of any floating point value returned by the command. The valid range of precision values are 1 to 8.

-----------------------------------------

di    : disregardIndex  [boolean] ['edit']
    This flag can only be used in conjunction with the -ac/attributeChange flag. If it is specified, and the HUD is attached to a multi (indexed) attribute, then the HUD command will run no matter which attribute in the multi changes.

-----------------------------------------

ev    : event           [string] ['edit']
    Runs the command when the named event occurs. The named event, must be a pre-defined Maya event. To get a list of what events exist, use the -le/listEvents flag.

-----------------------------------------

    Text string that appears to the left of the desired information.

-----------------------------------------

lfs   : labelFontSize   [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the font size of the label. Available sizes are: small and large.

-----------------------------------------

lw    : labelWidth      [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the pixel width of the virtual "textbox" which will hold the label. The contents of this "textbox" will be left justified. If the width of the actual label exceeds the width of the "textbox," the label will be truncated to fit within the dimensions of the "textbox." (To see a layout of a block, see the description of the -block flag.)

-----------------------------------------

lob   : lastOccupiedBlock [int] []
    Returns the block number of the last occupied block in a given section.

-----------------------------------------

lv    : layoutVisibility [boolean] ['query', 'edit']
    Sets the visibility of Heads-Up Display layout on and off. This does not modify individual visibilities of heads-up displays, but turns off the layout so that no heads-up displays will draw to screen. Personalized settings for the visibilities of HUDs are kept safe. This flag can only be used by itself, excepting edit and query.

-----------------------------------------

lc    : listConditions  [boolean] ['query']
    This flag will return a string array containing all names of the available conditions.

-----------------------------------------

le    : listEvents      [boolean] ['query']

    This flag only permits the EDITING of the name of the Heads-Up Display.

-----------------------------------------

nfb   : nextFreeBlock   [int] []
    Returns the block number of the next free block in a given section.

-----------------------------------------

nc    : nodeChanges     [string] ['query', 'edit']
    Works only with selection based triggers (ie. "SelectionChanged" or "SomethingSelected"), otherwise this flag is ignored. This flag attaches the HUD script to execute on specific node changes of any selected node. This flag is used to set a nodeChange. In order to reset a nodeChange, use the -rnc/resetNodeChanges flag. To view a list of all available node changes, use the -lnc/listNodeChanges flag. The following is a list of available node changes and their function:                attributeChange:  The script will be sensitive to any attribute changes in the currently                       selected nodes.                    connectionChange: The script will be sensitive to any connection changes in the currently                       selected nodes.                    instanceChange:   The script will be sensitive to any changes to an instance in the                       currently selected nodes.       On query mode, this flag will return the values of all nodeChanges in pairs of values (the name of the nodeChange followed by its value).                WARNING: (Performance Warning)              Attaching a nodeChange trigger to a selection based trigger can cause a large              performance drop, if the node change that is being watched is caused by the              HUD script itself.                             With this said, an attempt should be made to keep the HUD command/script                      simple and limited to retrieving data. Changing an attribute, creating or                      modifying a connection or instance will all result in a performance drop.

-----------------------------------------

p     : padding         [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Specifies the width of both the left and right margins of a block. Default value is 15 pixels.

-----------------------------------------

pre   : preset          [string] ['query', 'edit']
    This setting is used to select certain pre-defined HUDs, some of which retrieve specific data, that is unobtainable through normal MEL commands or scripts. This flag is mutually exclusive from the command and trigger flag combination. However, presets can work with all other headsUpDisplay attribute flags (ie. block alignment, label, dataFontSize, etc.), unless otherwise specified below. To obtain a list of available presets, use the -lp/listPresets flag on this command.  The following is a list of available presets and a description of each:  cameraNames      This will return the camera name that the view is looking through, in the data block, for each view that the HUD is drawing to. polyVerts      This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of vertices that are visible by the camera.     * 1st Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, both active and inactive.   * 2nd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, on active objects only.   * 3rd Value: Represents the number of camera visible vertices, that are active.  polyEdges      This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of edges that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. polyFaces      This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of faces that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. polyUVs      This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of UVs that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. polyTriangles      This will return three values in the data block, regarding the number of triangles that are visible by the camera. The order of these three values are similar to the polyVerts preset. materialLoadingCount      This will return the material loading count.

    This flag is only used in conjunction with the query flag. Calling a query on this flag returns the most recent result of the HUD.

-----------------------------------------

s     : section         [int] ['query', 'edit']
    Defines the section the HUD will appear in. There are 10 sections divided across the screen. Five columns and two rows make up the ten element matrix which divide the main viewport. Here is a visual layout of the sections.                 ________________________     |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |     | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |     |    |    |    |    |    |     |____|____|____|____|____|     |    |    |    |    |    |     |    |    |    |    |    |     | 5  | 6  | 7  | 8  | 9  |     |    |    |    |    |    |     |____|____|____|____|____|  Each section is denoted by a number from 0 to 9 as illustrated above. For example, if the second column of the top row was desired, the section would be defined as: -sec 1  To prevent HUD objects from displaying over each other and causing a clutter of letters, each row has a defined visibility precedence, where each section would have a visibility priority level. Depending on each priority level, when the screen space begins to shrink to a point where the section widths of a given row begin to collide, the HUD automatically compensates for this by removing the sections of least priority. These sections are made invisible and a warning is issued to inform the user of the removal. This continues until only the section of highest priority remains.  For each row, the priorities are defined as follows. Using the top row as an example: Section 0, has the highest priority, followed by Section 4, making the outermost sections of highest priority. Next in the list is Section 2, and lastly Sections 1 and 3 are of the equal and least priority. This priority structure can be applied to the bottom row as well. The two outermost sections have the highest priority, followed by the middle section, and finally the remaining two sections are of lowest priority.  This means that as the viewport gradually decreases in width to the point where sections in the top row begin to overlap, sections 1 and 3 will be removed from view first, followed by section 2, and finally section 4. A similar note is provided below for the block layout.

-----------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------

overrideModifier is undoable, NOT queryable, and NOT editable.

This command allows you to assign modifier key behaviour to other parts of the
system. For example you can use a hotkey or input device instead of a modifer
key to perform the same action.

Note that the original modifier key behaviour is not altered in anyway. For
example, if you've assigned "Ctrl" key behaviour to the "c" key then the
"Ctrl" key will still work as you expect, all you've done is allowed yourself
to use the "c" key as an alternative to the "Ctrl" key.

Return Value:

None
